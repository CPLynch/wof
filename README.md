## Dependancies

## Tests

To run 'npm test'<br>
3 tests - one for each rule set out

### Assumptions

Any two week period taken to mean from the start of any week rather than whole fornights.<br>
(this has the side effect of any engineer picked twice in the first week will be picked twice in all the odd weeks, and
any picked once in the first will be picked once in all subsequent etc).<br>

Both shifts for the day are to be picked at the same time.<br>
